<i>This program came from an idea of 2005.<br />
The goal was to explore the possibilities of Java world.<br />
With its old, new technologies and the current design patterns.<br />

<p>In one word, this project is a lab.<br />

<p>Feel free to explore, modify and improve this project...

<p>Finally, I would like to thank all my parents and especially my wife.
